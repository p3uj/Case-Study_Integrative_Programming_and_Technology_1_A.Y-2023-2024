# LESSON 4 - PYTHON LIST

## Problem 1
Define the variables x and y as lists of numbers
- x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- y=[11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
- z=[21, 22, 23, 24, 25]

a. What is the value of 3*x?

b. What is the value of x+y?

c. What is the value of x-y?

d. What is the value of x[1]?

e. What is the value of x[0]?

f. What is the value of x[-1]?

g. What is the value of x[:]?

h. What is the value of x[2:4]?

i. What is the value of x[1:4:2]?

j. What is the value of x[:2]?

k. What is the value of x[::2]?

l. What is the result of the following two expressions?

## Problem 2
Create a list with the following six items: 67, 62.9, “hi”, False, 8, 67, ‘apple’, 6.5.
- Begin with the empty list shown below, and add 8 statements to add each item, one per item.
- The first four statements should use the append method to append the item to the list, and the last four statements should use concatenation.

## Problem 3
Starting with the list of the previous exercise, write Python statements to do the following:
- Append “banana” and 67 to the list.
- Insert the value “dog” at position 3.
- Insert the value 909 at the start of the list.
- Find the index of “hi”.
- Count the number of 67s in the list.
- Remove the first occurrence of 67 from the list.
- Remove False from the list using pop and index

## Problem 4
Write a program that asks the user to enter size of list and input a list of integers. Do the following:
- Print the sum of items in the list.
- Print the last item in the list.
- Print the list in reverse order.
- Print Yes if the list contains a 5 and No otherwise.
- Print how many integers in the list are less than 5.
- Remove the first and last items from the list, sort the remaining items, and print the result.

## Problem 5
Start with the list [8,9,10]. Do the following:
- Set the second entry (index 1) to 17
- Add 4, 5, and 6 to the end of the list
- Remove the first entry from the list
- Sort the list
- Double the list f. Insert 25 at index 3
- The final list should equal [4,5,6,25,10,17,4,5,6,10,17]

## Problem 6
Write a program that asks the user for an integer and creates a list that consists of the factors of that integer.

## Problem 7
Write a program that removes any repeated items from a list so that each item appears at most once.
- For instance, the list [1,1,2,3,4,3,0,0] would become [1,2,3,4,0].
